# ng2-systemjs-demo

A minimal [Angular2](https://angular.io/) playground using [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [SystemJS loader](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)

This is a fork of [ng2-play](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play) to demonstrate the use of [ng2-toasty](https://github.com/akserg/ng2-toasty).

## Install

Clone this repo and execute in your favourite shell:

* `npm i -g gulp` to install gulp globally (if you don't have it installed already)
* `npm i` to install local npm dependencies

## Play

After completing installation type in your favourite shell:

* `npm run play` to start an Angular2 playground application in a new browser window. Application files are observed and will be re-transpiled on each change.
